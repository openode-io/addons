# Mongodb

MongoDB is a cross-platform document-oriented database. Classified as a NoSQL database program, 
MongoDB uses JSON-like documents with optional schemas. https://www.mongodb.com/

This addon provides a mongo instance with user, password, and database name access.

IMPORTANT: persistent_path should NOT be changed. Also, make sure to set MAX_BUILD_DURATION to at least 100: openode set-config MAX_BUILD_DURATION 100.

See sample Node.js connecting to the Mongodb addon: https://github.com/openode-io/kb/blob/master/mongodb/nodejs-connect.md
